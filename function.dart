/*dynamic Type
Purpose: dynamic is a special type in Dart that disables all type checking. It can hold any type of value, and you can perform any operation on it without the compiler checking for correctness.
Type Safety: dynamic does not enforce type safety, allowing any type of value to be assigned and any operation to be performed. This can lead to runtime errors if the operations are not valid for the actual type of the value.
Use Cases: Use dynamic when you need maximum flexibility, and type information is not known until runtime. However, use it sparingly to avoid losing the benefits of Dartâ€™s static type checking.
*/

/*num Type
Purpose: num is a type in Dart that serves as the common superclass for int and double. It is used to represent numeric values.
Type Safety: num enforces type safety, ensuring that only numeric operations are allowed on its instances.
Use Cases: Use num when you need to handle both integers and floating-point numbers, but want to maintain some level of type safety.
